                <div class="biography">
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Zhenhui Peng is an assistant professor (lecturer) in the <a href="http://sai.sysu.edu.cn/">School of Artificial Intelligence, Sun Yat-sen University</a>.  
                        Before that, he was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a>, working with Prof. <a href="http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/">Antti Oulasvirta</a>. 
                        He got his Ph.D. degree in Department of 
                        <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>, 
                        <a href="http://www.ust.hk/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>, 
                        supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/">Xiaojuan Ma</a>. 
                        He received his Bachelor degree in ESE from Nanjing University. 
                        He leads the <strong>HaiA (Human-AI Augmentation) lab</strong>, which aims at augmenting human intelligence in higher-order thinking activities (e.g., critical/creative thinking, decision making, problem solving) with user-generated content (e.g., posts and comments on social media) and AI-generated content. 
                        The application domains include vocabulary learning, art education, mental health peer support, critical reading, and so on. The research overview is as below.  
                        <!-- His research group focuses on Augmented Intelligence, which aims at improving human's task performance and ability using HCI and AI approaches. 
                        To achieve this goal, his group runs projects on: 
                        1) understanding what factors affect human's needs and behaviors via multi-modal modeling and analyses of user-generated content in online communities (e.g, about mental health, UI design),
                        2) facilitating human's task completion (e.g., critical reading, stress management) via engaging computer systems (e.g., chatbot, visualization), and
                        3) tutoring human knowledge and skills (e.g., vocabulary) via theory-based interaction design and AI-generative techniques.  -->
                        <!-- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its intersection with Artificial Intelligence. -->
                        <!-- His onging projects include: 
                        1) AI-powered (e.g., NLP, CV) interactive tools to address users' needs in various tasks (e.g., decision-making, problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity),
			            2) leveraging AI approaches to understand and assist users in online communities (e.g., about mental health, UI design),
                        and 3) developing intelligent systems in educational scenarios (e.g., vocabulary learning, paper reading, visual design). -->
